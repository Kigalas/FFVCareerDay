; SYLDRA
; Change Syldra's event to be tied to $A2, $11  ($7E0A16 bit 02), which is 
; Early game Pirate cave access. Could be a quasi-key item later 
org $D8EC45
db $11


; MUA FOREST
; Change checked flag from event code $A2, $71 to $A2, $72 ($000A22 bit 04 instead of 02)
; The reason for this is that $A22 bit 02 is connected to both guido and mua forest
; BUt Bit 04 is specifically tied to the fast 'reentrance' of mua forest
; So we can isolate mua forest as its own area, and guido can remain $A22 bit 02
; This code specifically means when Mua forest is looking for the bit, it's now checking 04 instead of 02 at $A22

; MOOGLE VILLAGE
; Event code [$A4, $3C] or setting bit 10 on $000A3B corresponds to both Tyrasaur being defeated and Moogle Village being open
; This fix allows for Tyrasaur to remain on $000A3B bit 10, while Moogle Village is swapped to another bit usually set upon 
; Finishing the Tyrasaur sequence, immediately set on new game ([$A4, $2C], or $000A39 bit 10)
org $D8EF5C
db $2C                     ;Refer to event code [$A4, $2C]


; MOOGLE WATERWAY
; For some reason, $000A1F bit 40 (event [$A2, $5E]) is both tied to the pre-Tyrasaur cutscene (not the pre-battle cutscene, the cutscene before that) and the barrier for Exdeath's castle
; This will disable the waterway cutscene from checking that bit, so it's left only to be barrier related
; We set it to check a bit that we ALWAYS know will be set, which is event code $A2, $10 from starting_flags 
; this is address $000A16 bit $10

; ZEZA FLEET
; After Gilgamesh, change one of the flags for Hiryuu spawning to normal to be based off of:
; db $A2, $AA                     ;Turn on bit 04 at address 0x7e0a29
; instead of 
; db $A2, $6D                     ;Turn on bit 20 at address 0x7e0a21
; Which is tied to Zeza allowing access to Barrier Tower
org $D8F254

; BARRIER TOWER
; Similar to above, change barrier tower fight cutscene to deactivate from a different flag than the underwater barrier access warp tile
org $D8F37D

; FORK TOWER
; Galuf in party causes problems. Temporarily setting access after Mua forest boss â†’ getting Cara
; Bit 80 at address 0x7e0a4b

; ANTLION
; Moved antlion's area tile up 1 into the river.
; This makes it so the player can only access as Boco, which avoids the regular situation forcing the player
; to be on Boco by walking on the world map (instead of accessing with Boco like vanilla)
org $CE2869 ; this changes tile
db $57
org $C8B218 ; this changes leaving cutscene to place Boco one tile right of this 
db $7A



; GARGOYLES
; Change each conditional event to have individual flags associated with their respective key items
; Only works for pyramid, the others had to be custom
