When using items in main inventory:

Item inventory start:
7E0640 

$C0EED0 - This is the 'usable item' index system for the item inventory. The IDs here correspond with the only usable items 
$c2a341 - First evidence where pressing a button on menu branches (checks stored A button press)


Selected item ID is loaded into $7E29E7
Then indexed & data from $D10A80 is loaded into adjacent WRAM bytes:

This ONLY has to do with restoratives in the restore menu. Need to understand what signifies restorative vs. not 
7E29E7 - index
7E29E8 - qty of item
7E29EA-D - Character selected
7E29EF - Set to $32 when using a potion, not changed on elixir. $32 = integer 50 
7E29F6 - restorative ID...? 81 = hp, 82 = mp, 83 = both

7E29F8 - restorative power
7E29F9 - restorative power (multiply F8 by F9)




Index table for asl'd item indexes:
7ED000 â†’ 7ED1FF

Starting around code $C2BB2B:
(first checks for Tent/Cabin and branches)
(then branches for stuff >= $F8?)

Loads index
ASL's it
Transfer to X
Uses X as an offset from lda $7ed000,x to get the specific location in D10A80 area, loads into A 
Transfer to X
Loads Y with some immediate #$29F3
Then moves item data based on index above 



For summons:
Takes index for summons, which are F9 FA FB, subtracts F8 to get an index of 01 02 03, then loads from (code C2BB6E) $C0EEAE, x
