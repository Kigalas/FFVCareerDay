; TO DO: CHECK IF C806 C906 ARE USED ELSEWHERE. IF SO, USE OTHER EVENTS
; what to do next:
; use an event flag that actually is free, not $FE, $54 / $A2, $54
; use an event that is acrtually free instead of CA 06. Check $20, $00 which appears to be canal cutscene 
; write conditional event for odin's spot for whatever the timer will be (new event code)
