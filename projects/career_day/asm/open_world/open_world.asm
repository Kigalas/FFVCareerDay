; SYLDRA
; Change Syldra's event to be tied to $A2, $11  ($7E0A16 bit 02), which is 
; Early game Pirate cave access. Could be a quasi-key item later 
; org $D8EC45
org $F04BC5
db $11


; MUA FOREST
; Change checked flag from event code $A2, $71 to $A2, $72 ($000A22 bit 04 instead of 02)
; The reason for this is that $A22 bit 02 is connected to both guido and mua forest
; BUt Bit 04 is specifically tied to the fast 'reentrance' of mua forest
; So we can isolate mua forest as its own area, and guido can remain $A22 bit 02
; This code specifically means when Mua forest is looking for the bit, it's now checking 04 instead of 02 at $A22
; org $D8F18E

; always trigger cutscene for opening path to boss
org $F04D66
db $FC, $FB
; MOOGLE VILLAGE
; Event code [$A4, $3C] or setting bit 10 on $000A3B corresponds to both Tyrasaur being defeated and Moogle Village being open
; This fix allows for Tyrasaur to remain on $000A3B bit 10, while Moogle Village is swapped to another bit usually set upon 
; Finishing the Tyrasaur sequence, immediately set on new game ([$A4, $C1], or $000A4C bit 02)
;org $D8EF5C
org $F04EDC
db $C1                     ;Refer to event code [$A4, $C1]


; MOOGLE WATERWAY
; For some reason, $000A1F bit 40 (event [$A2, $5E]) is both tied to the pre-Tyrasaur cutscene (not the pre-battle cutscene, the cutscene before that) and the barrier for Exdeath's castle
; This will disable the waterway cutscene from checking that bit, so it's left only to be barrier related
; We set it to check a bit that we ALWAYS know will be set, which is event code $A2, $10 from starting_flags 
; this is address $000A16 bit $10

; instead of 
; db $A2, $6D                     ;Turn on bit 20 at address 0x7e0a21

; ANTLION
; Moved antlion's area tile up 1 into the river.
