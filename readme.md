# Studio Big Bridge Projects
Both **FFV: Career Day** and **FFV: Project *Demi*** are developed here. **Career Day** is the open world randomizer of the game, that is built upon **Project *Demi***, an abbreviated version of the original FFV. All versions use the RPGe translation as its English text base. 

For any questions about either project, please visit the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6Yw6HbK) server.

# FFV: Career Day
**FFV: Career Day** is an open world randomizer of FFV, which abstracts many aspects of the game's original design for progression. Bosses are shuffled, random encounters can be toggled, and almost all rewards in the game, including event rewards, chests, shops & loot can be randomized. Further options such as a dynamic randomized weapon system with newly introduced weapon features, and custom end-game bosses exist as well. 

 *  All information regarding FFV: Career Day is available [on our Doku wiki](https://www.bigbridge.studio/cdwiki/doku.php?id=main_page)

# FFV: Project *Demi*

**Project *Demi*** is a quality of life hack for Final Fantasy V, designed for players who want to experience FFV hassle-free. Faster movement & abbreviated cutscenes let the player progress quickly while leaving the core gameplay and mechanics unaltered.

 *  All information regarding FFV: Project Demi is available [on our Doku wiki](https://www.bigbridge.studio/cdwiki/doku.php?id=project_demi)
